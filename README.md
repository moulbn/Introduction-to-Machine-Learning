# Testing Github on a Machine Learning Project

This is a first.


Initiation to multiple Machine Learning models:
 - Logistic Regression (Lasso/Ridge)
 - Discriminant Analysis
 - K-Nearest Neighbours
 - Decision Trees
 - Bagging
 - Random Forest
 - Gradient Boosting
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Neural Nets
